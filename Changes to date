Added form validation for registration form to prevent submission when some fields are blank.
Changed the addHyphon js function that adds in hyphons in date of birth. The function now clears the whole field when the backspace key is pressed, to prevent double hyphons
occuring when someone tries to delete and retype characters.

Changed database (and JDBC) to MS access
Removed address attribute from servlets, webforms and other classes
Added account details page and related servlet which uses 'toggle.js' - jQUery script i've written/adapted to send info to servlet to be written to database and 
confirm without need to reload the page.
Some CSS tweaks including making sure new page and functionality is neat on mobiles and tablet as well as desktop
Added a favicon
Updated files are in Data, src and web folders, can be copied directly to the GCU_Skills project folder

**IMPORTANT**
You'll need to change the path to the database file in the UserManager and PassHash methods to match the location on your computer.

You'll need to add all the libraries I've put in the 'lib' folder to the project for it to run, and your netbeans server will need to be set to Apache TomCat
which you may have to install. Jack or myself will be able to help with this if needed since we've both got it up and running.
Once TomCat is set up and all libraries have been added just press the play button in netbeans and the project should open in browser.

Working with SQLite pending me sorting my issues with ucanaccess JDBC.
Moved some stuff into different folders within 'web' to make it a bit neater.
Created StudentRegistrationServlet and StudentLoginServlet to act as controller classes for registration and login.
HTML files have now been replaced with jsp files to allow dynamic processing, old HTML files are still in a folder in 'web'.
Changed login method and included encryption for passwords.
Added some logic within pages that check whether user is logged in.
Temporarily have made new Student objects initialise with a blank 'new Date ();' because sqlite doesn't seem to support read/write of date objects.
Navbar is now a seperate file to minimise code duplication. It's included in all pages.
