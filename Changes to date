Working with SQLite pending me sorting my issues with ucanaccess JDBC.
Moved some stuff into different folders within 'web' to make it a bit neater.
Created StudentRegistrationServlet and StudentLoginServlet to act as controller classes for registration and login.
HTML files have now been replaced with jsp files to allow dynamic processing, old HTML files are still in a folder in 'web'.
Changed login method and included encryption for passwords.
Added some logic within pages that check whether user is logged in.
Temporarily have made new Student objects initialise with a blank 'new Date ();' because sqlite doesn't seem to support read/write of date objects.
Navbar is now a seperate file to minimise code duplication. It's included in all pages.
